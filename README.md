# SVAuth: Self-verifying single-sign-on solutions

SVAuth tries to provide the simplest and the most secure integration solution for a website to integrate single-sign-on (SSO) services. It is so simple that a website programmer doesn't need to know anything about SSO protocols or implementations. It is secure because every user login is formally proved for it logic correctness by the state-of-the-art program verifier. 

If your website needs SSO login, don't be overwhelmed by all kinds of libraries and protocol documents. Simply try SVAuth. It may save you tons of time and effort, and save your website from serious security bugs!

## Goal and status

**Goal**: To support all major web languages to integrate all major SSO services in the world.

**Status**: Currently support ASPX and PHP. Current SSO solutions include Facebook, Microsoft, Microsoft Azure AD, Google, Yahoo and Weibo. The list will grow.
